# AIDataGenerator
A program to generate historical sales data
The code in this project has been generated using AI (ChatGPT and deepseek) and is only for testing purposes.
#BEFORE UPLOADING FILES PLEASE:

     1. Rename the main program to DataGenerator_MYAIMODEL.py
     2. Add a final print command at the end of the program with the name of the model
          i.e.     print("\ndata generation by DataGeneration-MYAIMODEL.py")
     3. In the code make sure to rename all generated files to something_MYAIMODEL.csv
          i..e search for ".csv" and replace with _AIMODEL.csv"
     4. to add a unit test file for your program use: DataGenerator-TEST_MYAIMODEL.py
     

# Most programs should generate data files. 
# Example (test with O1 model):
     categories_O1.csv
     DataGenerator-TEST_O1.py
     DataGenerator_o1.py
     products_O1.csv
     stores_O1.csv
